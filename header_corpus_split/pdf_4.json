protection equipment recommendations described in sections 5 and 8. for large spills, provide diking or other appropriate containment to keep material from spreading. if diked material can be pumped, store recovered material in appropriate container. clean up remaining materials from spill with suitable absorbant. clean area as appropriate since spilled materials, even in small quantities, may present a slip hazard. final cleaning may require use of steam, solvents or detergents. dispose of saturated absorbant or cleaning materials appropriately, since spontaneous heating may occur. local, state and federal laws and regulations may apply to releases and disposal of this material, as well as those materials and items employed in the cleanup of releases. you will need to determine which federal, state and local laws and regulations are applicable. sections 13 and 15 of this msds provide information regarding certain federal and state requirements. note: see section 8 for personal

affected areas with cool water. chemical protective gloves are recommended. suitable gloves: avoid skin contact by implementing good industrial hygiene practices and procedures. select and use gloves and/or protective clothing to further minimize the potential for skin contact. consult with your glove and/or personnel protective equipment manufacturer for selection of appropriate compatible materials. inhalation: use respiratory protection unless adequate local exhaust ventilation is provided or exposure assessment demonstrates that exposures are within recommended exposure guidelines. ih personnel can assist in judging the adequacy of existing engineering controls. suitable respirator: general and local exhaust ventilation is recommended to maintain vapor exposures below recommended limits. where concentrations are above recommended limits or are unknown, appropriate respiratory protection should be worn. follow osha respirator regulations (29 cfr 1910.134) and use niosh/msha approved respirators. personal protective equipment for spills eyes: use full face respirator. skin: wash at mealtime and end of shift. if skin contact occurs, change contaminated clothing as soon as possible and thoroughly flush affected areas with cool water. chemical protective gloves are recommended. inhalation/suitable respirator: respiratory protection recommended. follow osha respirator regulations (29 cfr 1910.134) and use niosh/mhsa approved respirators. protection provided by air purifying respirators against exposure to any hazardous chemical is limited. use a positive pressure air supplied respirator if there is any potential for uncontrolled release, exposure levels are unknown, or any other circumstance where air purifying respirators may not provide adequate protection. precautionary measures: avoid eye contact. avoid skin contact. do not breathe vapor. keep container closed. do not take internally. use reasonable care. comments: product evolves flammable methyl alcohol when exposed to water or humid air. provide ventilation during use to control exposure within section 8 guidelines or use air-supplied or self-contained breathing apparatus. note: these
